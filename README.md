## 📂 Editing Content
This portfolio is content-driven via `/data/` JSON files, making it easy to update without editing HTML directly.

1. **Edit your content** in `/data/`:
   - `projects.json`: Add new projects.
   - `skills.json`: Update your skill buckets.
   - `leetcode.json`: Update DSA stats and links.
2. **Replace assets**:
   - `assets/avatar.png` — your photo (square recommended).
   - `assets/Rahul_Tathod_Resume.pdf` — your latest resume.
3. Open `index.html` locally to preview.  
   Deploy with **GitHub Pages** or **Netlify**.

## 📊 LeetCode Hover Card
For privacy and reliability, the hover card uses static data from `data/leetcode.json`.  
You can swap it for a live API or third-party image card if desired.

---

## 🔍 Project Kinds
Each project in `projects.json` should have one of:
- `data` — Data Science
- `ml` — Machine Learning
- `algo` — Algorithms
- `viz` — Visualizations  

The filter buttons will show/hide projects by kind.

## 🎨 Customizing the Theme
Colors, fonts, and layout can be adjusted in `/css/styles.css` to match your personal branding.
